- 👋 Hi, my name is Marcin. My profession is finance (controlling, management and financial accounting). My plan for the near future is to improve my professional skills with the new tools and concepts which I learned about data analysis and software development.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming concepts, and learning how to solve the issue using the software. Data analysis to provide efficient and reliable output to make the right business choices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, and Algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-life projects.
